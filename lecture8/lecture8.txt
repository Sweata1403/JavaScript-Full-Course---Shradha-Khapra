/Events in JS\
->The change in the state of an object is known as an Event
->Events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution.
• Mouse events (click, double click etc.)
• Keyboard events (keypress, keyup, keydown)
• Form events (submit etc.)
• Print event & many more

note: -> inline event handling means html tag k andr hi hum javascript k event handle krne ka command de skte hain.
      this is not recommended to handle events of javascript, because it makes our html code very much bulky.
      -> if we have given inline event handling in html and also in the js file we have given commands of event handling,
      the javascipt one will get the priority

better way to handle javascript:
Event Handling in JS
node.event = () => {
    //handle here
}

/Event Object\
->It is a special object that has details about the event.
->All event handlers have access to the Event Object's properties and methods.
-> "e" is the event object here
    node.event = (e) => {
        //handle here
    }
e.target, e.type, e.clientX, e.clientY

/Event Listeners\
node.addEventListener (event, callback)
node.removeEventListener event, callback)
*Note: the callback reference should be same to remove
