// Let's Practice
// Qs1. Prompt the user to enter their full name. Generate a username for them based on the input.
// Start username with @, followed by their full name and ending with the fullname length.
// eg: user name = "shradhakhapra", username should be "@shradhakhapra13"

let fullName = prompt ("enter your fullname without spaces");
let username = "@" + fullName + fullName. length;
console. log (username);
